// •	Declare a variable that stores an Array of at least 4 Strings.
var favRestaurants = ["Biaggis", "Qdoba", "PF Changs", "Raffs Tavern"]

// •	Declare a variable that stores an Array of at least 4 Numbers.
var ageFriends = [80, 48, 61, 56, 49]

// •	Declare a variable that stores an Array of at least 4 Booleans.
var arrBooleans = [true, true, false, false, false]

// •	Commit your work.

// •	Call a different Array method on each of the 3 arrays you created above. On the line of code above each method call, write (in a JavaScript comment) an explanation in plain English as to what impact calling that method will have on that specific array.

//Push Method
favRestaurants.push("Freddys");
console.log(favRestaurants);

//Pop Method
ageFriends.pop()
console.log(ageFriends);

//Shift Method
arrBooleans.unshift(false)
console.log(arrBooleans);
// •	Commit your work.

// •	[Intentionally open-ended] Demonstrate your understanding of index positions in this file. You can write an explanation, provide some examples with the Arrays you’ve created, or anything else.

//Let's index a few members of the favRestaurants
console.log(favRestaurants[0]);
console.log(favRestaurants[4]);
console.log(favRestaurants[1]);    
// •	Commit your work.

// Create another file in the same directory, name it self-evaluation.md. In Markdown, answer the following questions:
// •	How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
// •	Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
// •	What questions do you have about Arrays?
// •	Commit your work.
// After you’ve completed the tasks above, push your work up to a new GitHub repository. Provide the GitHub repository link in the submission form.
