Create another file in the same directory, name it self-evaluation.md. In Markdown, answer the following questions:
•	How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
    *Feeling ok about arrays, and okay with the concept of indexing them.  Not feeling as comfortable about methods.  Most likely something that I'll need to look up for a bit yet.*
•	Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
    *I'd like to know some real world uses for a few of the array methods.  Right now it feels like something that's just kinda hanging there with no feel for how it applies later on.*
•	What questions do you have about Arrays?
    *Boolean arrays - I don't know if I did this correctly or not.  When/how would you use them. And did I do that correctly?*
